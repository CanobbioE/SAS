# Development of Software Applications

Source code is located inside the "codice" folder. Note that this project aims to teach students how to write proper documentation, this means that the code could contains bugs.

The application's developement has been diveded in three subsets:

- **Subset 1:** Implementation of creating and joining a match
- **Subset 2:** Implementation of the training feature.
- **Subset 3:** Implementation of the actual gameplay.

Each folder (s1, s2 and s3) contains **only the documentation** for the specified subset.

This project has been developed using the iterative and incremental software development process framework known as [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process "Wikipedia").
