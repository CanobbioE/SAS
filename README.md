# Development of Software Applications

This project aims to teach students how to write well documented code using agile software development.

The project takes inspiration from the boarding game "Robo Rally" and tries to implement the game in a java application.

The application's developement has been diveded in three subsets:

- **Subset 1:** Create and join a match
- **Subset 2:** Training mode.
- **Subset 3:** Play the game.

Each folder (s1, s2 and s3) contains the documentation for the specified subset.
The source code can be found in the src folder.

This project has been developed using the iterative and incremental software development process framework known as [Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Process "Wikipedia").
